## About me

I am a 20 something software engineer living and working in Austin, TX.  I spend most of my money on travel, beer and eating out of food carts.

One day I used one of those sites meant to generate a "sweet new web startup company name".  It spat out [grimhappy.com](http://grimhappy.com) and for some reason I
really liked it.

This is mostly a place for me to ramble about code, music and food.
